<h2> Abstract Random</h2>
<h4> A little bit about Abstract Random</h4>
<p> Surprise! The girl who has traveled all over the world in the last year likes a spur of the moment lifestyle.  Abstract Random thinkers tend to visualize and conceptualize the project they are working on and Random thinkers prefer to accomplish the project in a non sequential order. These thinkers thrive in people oriented low structure environments.

<h3> Combating Struggles</h3>
<p> As I'm sitting here in the airport getting ready to board the plane to San Francisco all I can think is "wow, this is really happening". Phase 0 consisted of many struggles, but many accomplishments as well. I think my biggest struggle was not believing in myself and getting overwhelmed. Sometimes I would look at a problem, read the directions and think "oh boy this is going to be really hard" and then my mentality would sort of shut down to the problem at hand.  When I would do the smae problem with other people, however, I found that once we started working on the problem I had plenty of my own ideas to contribute and just was ready to go. I think this struggle has to do with negative visualization or too much visualization. To combat this when confronted with a challenge I need to calm the fears and take things one step at a time. Once I have the first step out of the way I can open up the flood gates of ideas and continue pursuing the challenge in a calm manner. </p>
<h3>How can I apply what I know about my learning style to further my DBC career?</h3>

<p> I think I'm going to start hanging this picture in my apartment as a reminder that YOU as a person can shape your mindset. With Abstract Random thinking I know that who I surround myself with is critical to my overall mood and thinking.  So far everyone I've talked to in my cohort is really intelligent and supportive. While I realize these relationships are going to be brand new and everyone will be doing their own thing, the lack of negativity has been super helpful.  While I naturally embrace challenges I sometimes get burnt out and then proceed to procrastinate. To diminish this effect I realize now, I can change the order in which I do things or I can seek advice/counsel from others. A quick chat can help me realign my morale and jump back into what I'm working on.  </p>
<p>  I love learning more about myself as we try to accomplish the seemingly impossible. While I see the importance in these tests, I ultimately think they are a lot like the Houses in Harry Potter. You hvae natural instincts, but YOU decide what YOU do with your life and how you succeed.  These are helpful tools, but for me at the end of the day (sort of like the fixed/growth mindset suggests) I'll define me.</p>
