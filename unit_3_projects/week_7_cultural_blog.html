<div id="text" style="text-decoration:none"> <h2> Affirming Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>
	<h3>Taking a Look at My Values Again</h3>
	<p> So I took a look again at the words that I chose as my values. For review my values are <ul> <li> Accomplishment</li>
		<li> Achievement</li>
		<li>Ambition</li>
		<li> Creativity</li>
		<li> Independence</li>
		<li> Harmony</li>
		<li> Inspiration</li>
		<li> Helping Society</li>
		<li> Enthusiasm</li>
		<li> Persistance</li>
	</ul>

Out of this bunch I decided one that I really wanted to focus on was persistance. My reasoning was that if you keep trying and don't give up on the things that matter to you, eventually things will work out.  </p>
<h3> Values vs. Threat </h3>
<p> My values list is really a compolation of the person I want to be and the things I care about most.  Each word invokes a memory and also a vision. The two work side by side to remind me that I have accomplished many things and there is so much I have yet to accomplish. While the latter usually fills me with excitement and determination sometimes especially when I feel threatened it can become overwhelming. How can I possibly accomplish something when everything seems to be stacked against me? </p>
<h3> Dealing with Threat </h3>
<p> Nothing about me is conventional. When I do feel threatened by the insecurities and pitfalls I posess I do turn to my values without realizing it. I try to find something that's going to keep me going no matter what's going on. I tend to bounce off of other people's energy and so it's very important for me to maintain my anchor of positivity in a not so wonderful enviroment.  My main methods for coping with threats are as follows :
<ol> <li> Going to bookstores</li> <p> Sounds a little quirky right? But to me, every book is an accomplishment. Books are little pieces of authors' souls put out there for the whole world to judge. If someone is willing enough to share a bit of their soul with me and ask for my criticism (by either buying the book or leaving it on the shelf) I can surely stand to receive a little criticism from people about my work.</p>
	<li>Dance Parties</li>
	<p> It doesn't have to be long. Sometimes you just need 3 minutes. This gets me moving, let's me express myself, and gives me the opportunity to hear really confident lyrics. No one is going to make me feel inferior for who I am after a solid Lady Gaga jam. </p>
	<li> Getting Outside/Going on an Adventure</li>
	<p> Again it doesn't have to be a big "adventure", but doing something completely new or just a little outside of my comfort zone reminds me there is so much going on in the world and so much I can enjoy. For example I had been seeing someone for a couple of weeks and when he broke it off I was definitely upset. Then my neighbors asked me if I wanted to play "Ticket to Ride", an unique board game I had never heard of. We ended up playing four rounds immersing ourselves in a ludcris game, but it put a smile on my face and made things seem a little easier. </p>
</ol>

Now sometimes I realize that just up and leaving DBC isn't an option. For whatever reason I might have to stay on campus or it just doesn't make any sense to go somewhere else.  A good soldier always has an alternative combat plan. 
<h4> My Alternative Combat Plan</h4>
<ul>
<li> Walk Around the Room a bit</li> 
<li> Sit in a Corner for 5 minutes and be by myself</li> 
</ul> 

These are my initial thoughts about fighting off my stereotype threats. I'm sure when I get to DBC and as I learn more, different strategies will also pop up.  If anyone has any other please let me know!
