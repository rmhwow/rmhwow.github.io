<h2> Pairing is Caring</h2>
<p>So when I first went through the DBC handbook, frantically trying to soak in all the information I stumbled upon the concept of pair programming. My first thought was "oh god they're going to know I'm terrible and kick me out after the first time".  Obviously that didn't happen. What actually happened was I went to the exact opposite side of town that I was supposed to meet my first pair and in a rush made it to a small cafe just before he got there. It turned out to be a great expereinece. 

Turns out, turning your brain on and sharing everything going on in your head is the most vulnerable and rewarding thing a person can do. In no other situation would I tell someone the hardship of my day or the stupid sign I saw that made me laugh, but in the spirit of being fully aware and with your partner, you have to and it's great. It opens up the line for every idea coding wise and I think helps you get to the bottom of the problem faster.  
It's really tough getting all your thoughts out, I remember one challenge we were super stuck and there was so much silence. It's a weird habit inviting someone else into your center of thought, but the greatest thing is you get to find out just how different you are.  In the silence and frustration you might come out with a solution, but sometimes if you think out loud your partner connects to something faster and suddenly Stypi lines are appearing out of nowhere and you're involuntarily throwing your hands up in cheer because you've solved it. </p>
<h4> Feedback</h4>
<p> And then there's the part after pairing. FEEDBACK duh duh duh....Although seemingly meticulous, I feel feedback has a lot to offer. I like how Socrates has a part where you can write in your own feedback but then there's also a scale.  This way you can explain and give constructive advice to the person, but also rate them on a scale. So far feedback has been very helpful and I think I've learned alot. In the beginning I'd get feedback about how I needed to talk more or feel free to share ideas and now I get more responses that say I was doing a pretty good job of that. I also happened to pair with someone quite frequently and so it was fun to see the development of responses I'd get over time. Initially things were good, but not necessarily specific and now that we've worked together a bunch I can see my pair and my improvements. 

On the flip side writing feedback is just as important. I think the hardest part was figuring out how to say a criticism in the best way so the other person could learn from it without thinking it was this huge deal. Also a lot of times I just didn't have criticisms for people. There are so many fantastic people in this program sometimes the hardest part was pin pointing something that could have gone better. Which I think is probably the best result we could hope for.  </p>
