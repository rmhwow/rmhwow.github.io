<div id="text" style="text-decoration:none"> <h3> Website Redesign</h3> 
<p> There were some trails and tribulations in this challenge, but I can say I am very happy with the overall outcome. During the prep time for DBC, I've typically worked with people through Google Hangout.  Most of these people had about the same knowledge as I did regarding our work so feedback was less brazen and more constructive. For my website redesign, however, I decided to get feedback from an audience with no computer background skills. This wwas definitely a mixed decision.  I learned that not everyone you love and trust is great at giving feedback. I originally went to my mom for advice because she works with marketing and designing billboard concepts.  As much as I love her and respect her work, I soon found we could not work together on this issue.  She had a difficult time articulating what she did and didn't like about my website and hovered over me as I attempted to follow her advice.  This led to an merry-go-round situation frustration and negativity included.  The next day I went to my dad for advice.  His advice was constructive, clear, and he gave me examples of what he thought looked good.  Then he left me to work and in no time I was able to come back with something that we both thought looked clean and professional with a hint of my personality.  </p>
