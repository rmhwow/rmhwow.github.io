	<h4> How Stereotype Threat has Affected Me</h4>
<p> I'm so glad we get the chance to talk about this topic even though it's sometimes really difficult. I think for the most part everyone at least a little bit is affected by stereotype threats.  For me it has probably affected me the most in my family. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my family. I come from a family of all girls, girls who happen to be incredibly gifted at math and science. My younger sister is currently a senior in high-school and is taking math courses at a senior in undergraduate level.  My older sister just graduated from Vanderbilt University with her Masters in Accounting.  I'm extremely proud of both of them and think they are going to rock their given workfields and work past their own stereotypes.  But growing up, I was the "other O'Leary" or "the dumb sister" who couldn't do math. Now when tested in a standardize setting or something completely unrelated to the normal academics, I actually tested better.  There definitely was that element of because I was expected to reach a level that I clearly wasn't at, I did much worse than if I could have just been allowed to be me.  </p>
<h3> Stereotypes as They Relate To DBC</h3>
<p> Then of course there is being a woman and learning how to code. That's been an interesting ride of "oh really? you can do that?" "Why would you want to do that?" "Why would you even want to move?"  While I think DBC is an incredibly supportive environment there will always be times when people just don't click or are feeling insecure. My attack plan would go as follows <ol> <li> Take a Step Back from the Situation/Take a Break</li><li>If I'm feeling the threat talk to someone I trust first. If someone else is feeling the threat, reach out and console</li> <li> Construct a Plan to Confront the "Attacker" in a Non-Aggressive Way<li> <li> Talk It Out</li> <li> Leave What Happened Behind (because no one likes to be judged for their past mistakes. It truly could have been an accident.</li></ol>

<h3> Meaningful Feedback and Changes in the Workplace</h3>
<p>So I actually learned this technique in an internship program that was supposed to better preformance in the workplace, but I think it can really realte here.  The technique is referred to as "SBO" meaning "situation" "behavior" "Outcome". With this technique when you want to give feedback to someone you explain the situation that happened, what their behavior was, and then how the outcome was perceived to others. Then you can give your input for how the situation might have gone better. In this manner, the person can have a clear example of what you are talking about and not feel accussed or judged, but rather take the assesment as a helpful took.  I don't think this has to be a public thing, it can be just as effective if you have a one on one conversation with the person.  When you implement styles and regiments such as these for everyone in your workplace in both a positive and negative manner you can shape the behavior and moral for the better. </p>
