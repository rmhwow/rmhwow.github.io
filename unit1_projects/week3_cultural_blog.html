	<h2> Kitchen vs. Table Fireside Chat</h2>
<h3> My take on the DBC Experience </h3>
<p> This video was really fantastic. I sort of wish we had access to it earlier, but I'm glad I was able to see it regardless. I think DBC is going to be a total "kitchen" experience.  Going through prep and being left alone pretty much the majority of the time made me really nervous.  All I could think about was how much smarter everyone was going to be and what if I failed at DBC and how that would be so humiliating. In the video Shereef talks about this fear and also talks about the "impostor syndrome".  I definitely was/am still going through this a bit. But it was great to have someone call you out on it and say "Hey, this is what I look for in candidates and this is why you fit."</p> 
<h3> Changing Expectations</h3>
 <p> I don't know if my expectations have really changed, but I think my perspective definitely has. DBC has always said we are going to test you and drive you insane and make you uncomfortable but you're going to learn and love it. Interviewing for DBC I remember really wanting to be able to thrive in a crazy environment, but still definitely needing an insurance from others that this is what I should be doing or this is a respectable way to learn.  Now I'm excited for the kitchen.  I realize it's going to be messy and I might go down some wrong paths and have horrible fails, but at the same time I could make something really great.</p> 
  <h3>How I Feel About this Enviornment</h3>
  <p> I think this enviornment, this experience is terrifying - in such a needed way for me. I've spent my whole life sitting in a classroom, feeling unsatisfied, with narrow minded professors telling me my work would never "meet standards of academia". It's taken me a year of running through a foreign country, picking up and moving to a brand new city on the east coast, and DBC to realize I would HATE fitting academia standards. I want to be able to create new standards. Kind of like what Shereef was saying in the beginning of the video, this is my "are you crazy?!?!" year. I'm just starting to figure out so much about myself and what I want and Shereef seemed to know exactly what that felt like. It seems everyone at DBC knows the feeling of taking the biggest bet on yourself. Phase 0 has been CRAZY. I've loved meeting new people, spending all of my time happy frustrated and then feeling this overwhelming pride at figuring out the littlest thing. (seriously if that could be combined with a chocolate cake it'd be fantastic). </p>
  <h3> What I think is Going to Happen</h3>
  	I have a way of describing the future that may seem a little nerdy but it's the best way for me to describe what I think will happen as we grow at DBC.  You know at the beginning of a sci-fi movie where the main character is kind of that quiet pereson that no one really pays attention to? And then when they do pay attention the character initially is annoying and like "But the oracle said I'm not the one" and then at the climax/end of the movie they end up being this kick ass person that you can't help but love and admire? That's what I think is going to happen. I'm so glad someone decided to bet on me and my future at DBC (even though I told my roommate after the interview there was no way they were going to accept me) and I can't wait to become a kickass programmer. </p>
