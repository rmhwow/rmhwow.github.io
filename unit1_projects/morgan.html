<div class="text"> <p> So this is my solo challenge again. My reflection on this.  Honestly, I've had a tough time trying to get this to be how I want it, but I think I'm coming around a bend here. Hopefully. In the mean time let's put some stuff up.</p>

<h3> A little bit about Me </h3> <p> So I'm 21, I'm new to life as I like to say. This year as been, well, interesting I guess is the best word. Technically I go to <a href="http://lawrence.edu"/>Lawrence University.  It's a great school, I just haven't been there in a year. I've been a little busy with other things. </p>
