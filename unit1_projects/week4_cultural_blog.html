<div class="text" style="text-decoration:none"> <h2> Dealing With Conflict</h2>
<p> This topic is a little bit tougher for me because I rarely experience conflict with people. Sure there are times where I disagree or think "oh my gosh I can't believe that person just said that", but as I'm getting older most of what I would get upset about, I realized, is a reflection of my own insecurities.  The things I get upset about now are typically things that directly go against my beliefs. Some things I researched included the different types of conflict: interpersonal, intrapersonal, intergroup and intragroup. I also looked at the compass of shame and figured out where I typically fall in that mold. </p> 
<h3> Some Starting Out Info</h3>
<p>After reading the research I realized I am a classiv avoider and occasionally a self hater. When I am truly in the wrong I will punish myself more than anyone else ever could. However, if I am engaging in conflict to protect others or defend my beliefs I won't look back on the experience. I typically don't like conflict and will only really resort to it if absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3> Applying my Research to Conflict</h3>
 <p> A conflict I recently had involved my neighbors. One night I was invited out to dinner with the people who lived around me in my apartment building. I decided to join the group and was relatively comfortable with the people and setting. Seeing as at the time we lived in Washington DC, the conversation eventually lead to political theory. My neighbors all happened to be conservative whereas I am not (I'm libertarian). The discussion became about what libertarians believe and how their thought process goes. As the discussion was happening right in front of me, I chimed in to give perspective.  The two guys, however, told me I wouldn't know enough about libertarians. When I told them I was one they shut out my "immoral" opinions and proceeded to ignore me. Although I was upset I knew that confrontation was only going to lead me to look out of control and they would win.  Instead I decided to leave after dinner and not waste any more time wtih people I disliked. When I told everyone I wouldn't be heading to the bar for drinks, they teased me and the only person who defended me did so because she thought that I was leaving them to hookup with my boyfriend. I couldn't believe the arrogance and decided to walk the long way home. 
 	While I guess this really didn't improve the relationships or fix the situation I wouldn't change what I did. At this moment I realized that I had the right and ability to not take that crap from anyone. I didn't have to be a jerk, I didn't think they were awful people, I just knew that they weren't the type of people I wanted to really connect with. So on my walk home I blew off all my steam by talking to my other friends about the situation and coming to the conclusion that although you can live with some people you don't need to be best friends with them.</p>
