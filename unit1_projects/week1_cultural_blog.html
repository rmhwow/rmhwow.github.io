<h1>My Values</h1>
<p> Accomplishment, Achievement, Ambition, Creativity, Independence, harmony, Inspiration, Helping Society, Enthusiasm, Persistance</p>

<h2> Persistance is Important </h2>
<p> Life is all about perspective. Things can get tough, but if you keep your wits about you and keep trying, things will eventually work out. </p>

<h2> Living Up to My Values</h2>
<p> So do I live up to my values? Meh, I try, but I also know there's a lot of room for improvement. So I'm going to go ahead and rate myself a three. </p>
