<div class="text" style="text-decoration:none"> <h2> Class Methods Vs Instance Methods</h2>
<h3> Intro </h3>
<p> Welcome to a small guide on class methods vs. instance methods. My credentials are really only the articles I've been reading and the work I've been doing to apply the concepets. But hey that's basically everyone's credentials right? So Let's Get Started!</p> 
<h3> Class Methods</h3>
 <p> Class Methods are global methods. You can access and call them from anywhere in your code because you don't need an object instance. Some benefits of using a class method include having shorter code and less objects. The idea then would be to only lay out your method arguments.  Now there's a lot of hate against class methods. This is due to the fact that they are tough to refactor.  When yoour method can be called to all elements of the code, it's very tough to edit one part of the code. As well as the fact that because the method can be called from anywhere it's tough to construct for multiple Objects.  Here are some fun articles about class methods.

 </ul> </p> 
  <h3>Instance Methods</h3>
	<p> So Instance Methods, as the name suggests, means that the method is being used only within that block of code. Instance methods are also object oriented meaning that they affect the one specific object they are applied to.  There are a lot of strengths with Instance Methods. The readability is clear.  You can clearly tell what method is doing what and to which object.  It is also much easier to refactor. There's a lot of respect for the instance method. A lot of the articles I have seen have said that initially it might look like more sense to use class methods, but as you continue to learn the benefit of object orieneted ruby outweighs the class method.
