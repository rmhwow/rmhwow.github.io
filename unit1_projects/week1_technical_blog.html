<div class="text" style="text-decoration:none"> <h2> Analysis of Youtube, Elite Daily, and Yahoo</h2>
<h3> Youtube </h3>
<p> So Youtube is one of my favorite sites because you have so much access to virtual everything.  You can view anything from music videos to instructions to movies. It's also a great places to connect with people. /<p>
	<p> My eye is drawn towards the middle and the search bar. You can see so many videos. The site visually is an organized madness. I would describe it as "cluttered", "clean", "bright", "new age", and "colorful". </p>
	<p> This website solves the problem of sharing videos with others. I would describe the content as "entertaining", "unique", "practical", "musical", and "personalized". The focus adjectives I think fit pretty well with the visual adjectives.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy to find what you are looking for from the homepage. The search bar on Youtube is vital. Also when you watch a video it recommends other videos and you can click on them directly from the video you are currently watching making it super easy.  Usually when I spend time on the site I feel like I am happy.  I love watching comedy videos and I know I am wasting time, but the power of laughter really helps me get through the day. The site doesn't sell anything, but I do share videos quite often.  </p>
<h3> Elite Daily </h3>
<p> I love Elite Daily because it's an online magazine that is dedicated to people around my age. When I look at the site my eye is drawn to the header,it's black and contrasts the rest of the page. It is the most important part of the site because it directs you to the certain types of articles you would like to read. </p>
<p> I would describe this site visually as colorful, engaging, cluttered, inspiring, and fun. I would say it's pretty easy to find certain type of articles, but if you had a specific article in mind it would be difficult to find it if it wasn't hot currently. However, it is very easy to browse the site. Typically, when I spend some time on the site I feel more educated or entertained about what is going on. The site doesn't sell anything but again, I will share articles that I feel relate to people I know.</p>
<h3> Yahoo</h3>
<p> Again, I like this site for the articles and the hub that it provides for access to news, movies, email etc. My eye is drawn to the middle and rotating articles. </p>
<p>  This site visually is pleasant, colorful, engaging, informative, and entertaining. This site allows people to grab articles both newsworthy,  and entertaining. The content is newsworthy, entertaining, fun, practical, and light. I think these adjectives compliment the visual adjectives nicely.  Usually with this site I feel either informed about the world or about new tidbits about life. </p>
