<div class="text" style="text-decoration:none"> <h2> The Difference Between Hashes and Arrays</h2>
	<p>While both are used to store data there are some key differences between the two.</p>
<h3> Arrays </h3>
<p>Arrays are ordered list of things. A great time to use an array would be to call and list the months in a year. In that array you would have months= Array.new and then months=[Jan,Feb,March] and so on.  This is a list of things. By having an array, you can call on specific answers. For example if you wanted to know what the fifth month of the year was you would just have to call(print) month[4].  That command would grab the 4th element of the array(because remember arrays start at element 0) and you would be able to see what the fifth month of the year was.  </p>
<h3>Hashes</h3>
<p> Hashes are meant to store things with a meaning. The easiest way to describe this is a key (the thing) and it's value(what significance or meaning it has).  A great time to use a hash would be if you wanted to store members of a family. You could easily do 
	family  = Hash.new
	family= {
	'Mom'=>'Susan',
	'Dad'=> 'Jim',
	'Dog'=> 'Happy'
}
This gives the key roles of a family a value of the names of people. So when we call family['Mom'] we should get "Susan".  If you just wanted the name of the family members you could set up an array such as family=["Susan","Jim","Happy"].  With the array however, we don't have the specific role in place.
