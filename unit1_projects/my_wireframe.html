<h2> Ideas for my index page</h2>
<p> So I do want to make my website artsy and user accesible. I'm thinking a sort of logo off to the left and a headline.  A content area in the middle, and a sidebar that has links to my other works. Maybe I'll use images to make the other work seem for exciting.  Then a footer at the bottom with a nice quote. </p>

<h2> This is what I was thinking visually.
