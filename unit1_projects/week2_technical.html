<h3> So What's the Difference? </h3>
<p> When initally trying to figure out spacing on a HTML, it can be difficult to decipher what you need to use. The best thing for me so far is to keep this image in mind.<img src="/unit1_projects/images/square.png.gif"/></p>
<h3>Padding</h3> 
<p>Padding is the space between your content and the border. Padding is applied inside the element (this whole box you are trying to create) you are creating and affects how far away your content is from the border. Padding will affect the height and width of that element. <br>Here's what the element looks with 20px of padding. <img src="/unit1_projects/images/rsz_padding_20.png"/>
	<br> <p> And here's what the element looks like with 50px of padding. <img src="/unit1_projects/images/rsz_padding_50.png"></p>
</p>
	<p> As you can see the area around the content grows, but the content itself stays in place and although the entire object is bigger the border doesn't increase. It's like actually adding padding.</p>
	
<h3> Border </h3>
<p> Border is the area directly surrounding the padding. It frames this area with either a solid or dashed line. Here's a visual of a dashed vs. solid border. </p>
<h4>Dashed <img src="/unit1_projects/images/dashed.png"></h4>

<h3> Margin</h3>
<p> Margin is the area outside of you element. It's the area between your element the edges of your browser and the border. The margin affects how the elements on your page are placed and how far away they are from one another. The margin is also transparent. Here are some dramatic visuals so you can get an idea of what happens when you play with margins. </p>
<h4> With auto margins </h4>

<h4> With 300px</h4>

<p> As you can see the spacing between the elements completely changes.</p>
