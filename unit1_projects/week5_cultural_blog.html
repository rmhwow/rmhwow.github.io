<div class="text" style="text-decoration:none"> <h2> Why Aren't There More Women?</h2>
<h3> The Facts </h3>
<p> While 57% of occupations in the workforce are held by women only 25% of those are computing occupations.  In 1985 37% of female undergraduates received a degree in computer science. By 2010 that fell to 18% and at major universities it's 14%.  The numbers decrease with female college freshmen. 0.4% of female college freshmen say they intend to major in computer sciences.  </p> 
<h3> What are they thinking?</h3>
 <p> So why aren't women coding? Well from my brief research there is a lack of programs in earlier education. Without this exposure people don't even consider jobs in the tech field. Most women also don't think they would be good at the job or comfortable the people they would be working alongside.  There are also counless of articles online titled things like "The Lonley Female Coder".   </p> 
  <h3>Changing Expectations</h3>
	<p> So How can we change this cycle?  I think some of it has already begun to change. It seems like there are different venues for women to go who want to learn code such as Girl Code it. While they focuse specifically on women there are other sites that allow people to get a taste of coding.  Here are some ideas I have to increase coding interest, especially in women
	<ol>
	<li> Change the Stereotype</li> <p> I'm brand new to this expereince and I can't tell you HOW many times I've heard "oh you don't seem like a coder to me." People assume someone who codes is just a person who sits in their basement furiously fighting with their terminal Neo style.  Not the people who are online creating and making our world a faster/more efficient place. </p> 
<li>Get People Exposed to Code Early On</li>
<p> I'm genuinely upset that I didn't have any exposure to this earlier. And why wasn't this a part of my middle school, high school, or even college education? I was forced to take home ec and a diversity class because they had reputible skills. Coding is the way of the future and it's time to give students at least a little bit of exposure to that. </p>
<li> Make it Okay to Like to Code</li>
<p> This kind of goes along with the changing stereotypes bit, but I can't tell you how many times I've been told "oh I didn't think you were actually capable of that" or "I didn't realize you were into that nerdy stuff" with this ever superior tone of distain. Why? Why can't I like something that allows me to solve problems and create new and amazing things for other people? If I didn't have the DBC support group, I think I probably would have looked at code, liked it, and maybe done more with it secretly, but probably wouldn't have had the confidence to come out and be vocally passionate let alone search for a job. 
<li> Create More Support Systems</li>
<p> I think personally this is one of DBC's biggest strengths. While in some ways we are in competition for jobs and opporunities, everyone has been so supportive and just as eager to learn. Having a network of people who understand what you are doing and how you are getting there is truly invaluable and I think could really help the tech world even more.  </p>
</ol>
So There you have it. My ideas and thoughts of getting more women into the tech world.
