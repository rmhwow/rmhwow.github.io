<h1>Why I chose this photo</h1>
<p> Originally, I was going to put up a photo of myself, and then I said "Morgan, give the people what they want." I was trying to think of what I would want if I was a tad bit stuck on coding (but making wild congratulatory noises everytime there was success).  Then it dawned on me.  I would want Ryan Gosling.</p>
<h1> My Top Favorite Songs While Making This Website</h1>
<ul>

<p>As you can see it's been a very Beyonce focused afternoon ;) </p>
