 <p style="text-align:center" id="content"> Hi, My Name's Morgan O'Leary. Welcome to my first solo website, I'm pretty excited and proud of the work that's been put in here. Throughout Dev I want this to become better and better. Just like a real website! Let the Journey Begin! </p>

	<h1>Why I chose this photo</h1>
<p> Originally, I was going to put up a photo of myself, and then I said "Morgan, give the people what they want." I was trying to think of what I would want if I was a tad bit stuck on coding (but making wild congratulatory noises everytime there was success).  Then it dawned on me.  I would want Ryan Gosling.</p>

<h1> A little more about me </h1>
</p> So I'm currently 21 and living the working life in Washington DC. Home of our nation's capital! Where I live is right by the Capitol Building, which I still to this day, think is the most beautiful building on the inside. Here's a picture </p>
<p> I also love discovering youtubers. I mean I don't discover them, but I love finding up and comers and just hearing them develop. It sort of inspires me. It makes me think that while they're cultivating their singing skills I can be cultivating my programming skills. </p>
<h2> Here's one of my favorites, Christina Grimmie, rocking out on the voice! </h2>
